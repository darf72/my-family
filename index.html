<title></title>all about dogs 
<body>
<body></body>Dogs are loyal, intelligent companions that have been domesticated for thousands of years. There are many breeds, each with unique traits. Dogs communicate through body language, barking, and wagging their tails. They need daily exercise and a balanced diet to stay healthy. Regular vet visits help prevent health issues. Dogs also serve roles like therapy animals or working dogs in fields like search and rescue. They're loved as pets for their playful and affectionate nature!
